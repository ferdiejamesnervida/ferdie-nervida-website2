When you have your cybersecurity certification photo ready, follow these steps:

### 1. Add the Image File
- Place your certification photo in the main website directory (same level as `index.html`)
- Name it something like `cybersecurity-certification.jpg` or `public-sector-cert.jpg`

### 2. Update the HTML
In `index.html`, find the certification section (around line 142-150) and replace:

```html
<div class="cert-placeholder">
    <div class="placeholder-content">
        <span class="placeholder-icon">🏆</span>
        <p>Cybersecurity Certification Photo</p>
        <small>Add your certification image here</small>
    </div>
</div>
```

With:

```html
<img src="your-certification-photo.jpg" alt="Public Sector Cybersecurity Certification" class="cert-photo">
```

### 3. Update the Alt Text
Make sure to update the `alt` attribute with a descriptive text for accessibility.
